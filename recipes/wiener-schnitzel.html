   <p> This wiener schnitzel is an easy German recipe and one of our favorites. Boneless pork chops can also be substituted for veal and taste excellent!</p> 
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 1 1/2 pounds veal cutlets</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> 2 large eggs</li>
    <li> 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons milk</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoons minced parsley</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li> 1 pinch ground nutmeg </li>
    <li> 1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li> 6 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li> 4 slices lemon</li>
</ul>

<h2> Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Place veal cutlets between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound cutlets with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness. Dip cutlets in flour to coat; shake off excess.</li>
<li>Beat together eggs, Parmesan cheese, milk, parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a shallow bowl until combined. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Dip each cutlet into the egg mixture, then press in bread crumbs to coat. Place coated cutlets on a plate and refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight.</li>
<li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook breaded cutlets in butter until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer cutlets to a serving platter and pour pan juices over them. Garnish with lemon slices.</li>
<li> Enjoy!</li>
